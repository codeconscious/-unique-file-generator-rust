# Unique File Generator (written in Rust)

Rewriting my [C# unique file generator](https://github.com/codeconscious/unique-file-generator) in Rust as a way to get more familiar with Rust. I'm just getting underway, though, so there's nothing much to see—let alone use—yet.

## TODO

- [ ] Reimplement all features of the C# tool
- [ ] Likely add [indicatif](https://github.com/console-rs/indicatif)
